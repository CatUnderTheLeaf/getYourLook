  comments:
    - A hairstyle with a strong angular front and adding height will help to elongate the face
    - Avoid over softening this already round shape and avoid creating more width on sides. This will accentuate the shape further
    - It's best to leave your hair down and avoid tucking it behind your ears
    - No straight parting in the center (if there is a parting, then oblique and from the side)
    - No slicked-back hair - it should fall in front of the face
    - No ball hairstyles
    - The main trick of this hairstyle is the long strands in the front, falling below the chin line. They should be straight (if necessary, you can pull them out with a flat iron)
